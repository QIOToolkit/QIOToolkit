Built-in Solvers
================

| Solver | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [Simulated Annealing](../../spec/solver/simulated-annealing.md) | Simulates independent replicas with metropolis dynamics while gradually cooling the system. |
| [Parallel Tempering](../../spec/solver/parallel-tempering.md) | A chain of metropolis replicas from a low to high temperature regime with exchange dynamics. |
| [Population Annealing](../../spec/solver/population-annealing.md) | A population of metropolis walkers with resampling. |
| [Substochastic Monte Carlo](../../spec/solver/substochastic-monte-carlo.md) | A population of random walkers with resampling |
| [Multi Objective Replica Exchange](../../spec/solver/murex.md) <br/> (MUREX) | A network of metropolis nodes in temperature + parameter space with exchange dynamics |
