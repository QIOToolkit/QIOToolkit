* Respect personal boundaries and personal identities.
* Give credit where credit is due and acknowledge the contributions of others.
* Welcome constructive criticism and be open to learning.
* Show commitment to the wellbeing and success of the community.
* Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

Offensive or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, or any form of
public or private harassment. Publishing others' private information without
their explicit permission. Other conduct that could be reasonably considered
inappropriate in a professional setting.
