Build with CMake
================

qiotoolkit uses cmake as its build system. There are multiple
build configurations available to choose from.

  * `Debug` (default): During development, you may want
    to rely on a non-optimized build with debug symbols.
  * `Release`: Uses optimization flags, strips debug
    symbols and all asserts from the code.
  * `SelfConsistency`: Within walkers, check each `calculate_cost_difference()`
    against a full invocation of `calculate_cost()` (**VERY SLOW**).

cmake is typically invoked in a new folder, e.g.,
`path/to/qiotoolkit/cpp/YOUR_BUILD`.  The first time, `cmake ..` needs to be invoked
with the selected build type.  thereafter, you can simply `make` in that folder
(even when modifying `CMakeLists.txt` files).

> [!NOTE]
> The build type is also denoted in the `build` extensions found in each
> JSON response generated by the binary.

Debug Build (default)
---------------------

```bash
$ cd path/to/qiotoolkit/cpp
$ mkdir debug_build
$ cd debug_build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j8
```

Release Build
-------------

```bash
$ cd path/to/qiotoolkit/cpp
$ mkdir release_build
$ cd release_build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make -j8
```

SelfConsistency Build
---------------------

```bash
$ cd path/to/qiotoolkit/cpp
$ mkdir consistency_build
$ cd consistency_build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=SelfConsistency
$ make -j8
```

_Once built, you can continue to [running your first simulation](run.md)._
