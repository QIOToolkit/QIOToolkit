# Introduction

This project provides the components for building and running Quantum inspired optimization solvers that can solve different types of optimization problems that can be expressed as unbounded binary optimization problems.  

## Getting Started

Getting started with the QIO Toolkit is as simple as running a binary or building the binary yourself and then running it. We have a [tutorial](https://qiotoolkit.github.io/qiotoolkit/tutorial/index.html) that will guide you through the process of running the QIO Toolkit solver.

### Fetching a binary

You can fetch a binary for x86-64 cpu architecture from the latest [CI/CD](https://github.com/QIOToolkit/QIOToolkit/actions/workflows/qio-toolkit-ci-integration.yaml) run, under artifacts.

### Running the QIO Toolkit solver

After building the binary you can go a tutorial in the [documentation](https://qiotoolkit.github.io/qiotoolkit/tutorial/index.html) and go to `Run your first simulation`. This will guide you through the process of running the QIO Toolkit solver with data examples within the repo.

## Contributions

We have a [contributing guide](./doc/CONTRIBUTING.md) that outlines how to
contribute to the project. Please read it before making any contributions.

### Adding in a solver

If you are here to experiement and try to add in a solver. We have some specific documentation for that [here](https://qiotoolkit.github.io/qiotoolkit/tutorial/dev/solver.html).

## Code of Conduct

We have a [code of conduct](./doc/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect project
participants to adhere to. Please read it before participating in the project.
